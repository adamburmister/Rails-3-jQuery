About
=====
Rails template to setup a new Rails 3 app to use the new jQuery drivers instead of the default prototype ones.  More information is available at: http://loganleger.com/rails-3-jquery.

How to Use - New Project
========================
`rails new <appname> -m <path/to/jquery.rb>`

**The template will ask you if you want to override :defaults and add :jquery or just do one or the other.**

So, for example, if you make download this template in `~/Sites`:<br>
`rails new <appname> -m ~/Sites/jquery.rb`

Otherwise, you can run it directly from github like so:<br>
`rails new <appname> -m http://github.com/lleger/Rails-3-jQuery/raw/master/jquery.rb`

This template also makes a new javascript expansion if requested, :jquery, for use in the javascript_include_tag. For example:<br>
`<% javascript_include_tag :jquery %>`

How to Use - Existing Project
=============================
If you're converting a Rails 3 app to jQuery, you can use
`rake rails:template` to execute the template inside your existing app.

`rake rails:template LOCATION=http://github.com/lleger/Rails-3-jQuery/raw/master/jquery.rb`

Process
=======
This template works via this process:

1.	Remove old prototype js
2.  Download latest jQuery min and place into javascripts folder
3.  Download latest jQuery drivers and place into javascripts folder
4.  Create requested javascript expansions

License
=======
You are free to make any and all modifications to the template and use it in whatever appropriate context you desire, as long as you keep the attributions in place.
